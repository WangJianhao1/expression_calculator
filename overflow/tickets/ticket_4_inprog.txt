Task:
	Move overflow operations into a header and cpp file pair. Update
	the unit tests to have an include directive for these functions.

Operations to move:
	Divide with precision [x]
	Add, subtract
	Multiply with precision

Unit tests to update:
	Divide with precision [x]
	sci_to_d [x]			
	remove_decimal [x]
	add_decimal [x]

The divide and multiply with precision will share some subroutines. 
Create a seperate header cpp file pair for these and include as
necessary.
